Notes on Android with Kotlin

## Getting started

What you need to start learning Android
* Android Studios

## Virtual or Real Device
Tools > AVD Manager.  When I installed Android Studio there was already a Virtual Device (Pixel 3) ready for me to use, convenient!
* Version of Android
* Device to Emulate

## Understanding Project Options
* Project - show files as they are on the filesystem
* Android - shows files in a way that's "helpful"

## Android Project View
* manifests - essential app details so an OS can launch the app, defines permissions
* java - all Kotlin code lives here
* java(generated) - files built by Android Studio, don't edit these
* res (resources) - static content to be used in the app
* Gradle Scripts - Files used to build and run the app
